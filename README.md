# ZAMMTO224_FTC2306_GROUPB_ZamatoloMtolo_ITW_Digital_Resume
 I wanted to create a multipage website but I kept it to two pages  as I didnt want to lose the information.
 Colors I went for are orange, yellow and brown which are bold colors and yellow was my favoruite. I wanted to work with daring colors as I normally go for pastels.
 Since the colors are daring and it is a double page resume, I played it safe in terms of layout.
